# Backlog for Spell Checker

Updated: 13.3.2021

## Steps to be done

* Start testing
* Create first version of Levenshtein algorithm
* Provide first simple solutions (for list of same length, for example) with it
* Calculate distance with wider range of word lengths if results are not good enough
* Level-up the algorithm to be optimal string alignment distance
* Enhance the correctiveness by weighting letters next to each other on keyboard more (or at least test if it helps)
* Search for other weights or other ways to increase the efficiency and precision of the algorithm
* Perhaps try to decrease the memory complexity of optimal string alignment distance (it does not need to keep all the indexes in memory all the time)
* Decide and create more effective data structure for dictionary

## Done

* Create a definition document 13.3.2021
* Create project structure 14.3.2021
* Read in the word list resource, first to array containing arrays 14.3.2021
* Create a simple text UI 14.3.2021
* Check if the word resource contains a word provided by user 14.3.2021
