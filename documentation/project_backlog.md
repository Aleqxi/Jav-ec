# Backlog for Spell Checker

Updated: 21.3.2021

## Steps to be done

* Create test files and start testing
* Provide first simple solutions (for list of same length, for example) with it
* Calculate distance with wider range of word lengths if results are not good enough
* Level-up the algorithm to be optimal string alignment distance
* Rewrite the contains method with own code
* Enhance the correctiveness by weighting letters next to each other on keyboard more (alphabet-weight edit distance)
* Weight uppercase and lowercase switches (perhaps in the beginning of the word?)
* Search for other weights or other ways to increase the efficiency and precision of the algorithm
* Perhaps try to decrease the memory complexity of optimal string alignment distance (it does not need to keep all the indexes in memory all the time)
* Decide and create more effective data structure for dictionary
* Create implementation document
* Create instructions of use
* In the end of the project, clean and finalize the user interface

## Done

* Create a definition document 13.3.2021
* Create project structure 14.3.2021
* Read in the word list resource, first to array 14.3.2021
* Create a simple text UI 14.3.2021
* Check if the word resource contains a word provided by user 14.3.2021
* Add javadoc for existing classes and methods, finished 21.3.2021
* Create first version of Levenshtein algorithm and add it as an option to the user interface 21.3.2021
