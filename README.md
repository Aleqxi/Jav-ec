# Spell Checker

This is a course project for Data Structures and Algorithms lab course, University of Helsinki, spring 2021.

The course begins on March 2021 and the project is ready in May 2021.

## Trainer program

For finding frequences of different mistakes that my algorithm recognizes, I have written also a training program. The code is here [in its own folder](https://github.com/sallasal/SpellChecker/tree/main/TrainSpellChecker). If you want to help me with this projects, please upload the trainer program, use it (perhaps [from command line](https://github.com/sallasal/SpellChecker/blob/main/documentation/user_instructions.md#running-the-programs)) with some natural language sample texts and send me the result csv it writes to the project root. (Email: salla.salokanto at helsinki.fi)

I am analyzing a massive amount of blog texts from free corpus (see credit below) but any help is good! The more the merrier.

Results this far are collected to the [result folder under trainer program](https://github.com/sallasal/SpellChecker/tree/main/TrainSpellChecker/results).

## Data credits

The word list currently found in [project resources](https://github.com/sallasal/SpellChecker/tree/main/SpellChecker/src/main/resources) has 15 000 most common English words and is fetched from [Audience Dialogue website](http://www.audiencedialogue.net/susteng.html).

The free natural language text corpus is used to find out best weights for different kind of mistakes. The corpus [can be uploaded for free](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm) and is created for this study:
